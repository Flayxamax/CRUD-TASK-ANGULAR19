# TASK CRUD 19

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

## Project Description

TaskCrud19 is a simple task management application built with Angular and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The application demonstrates the use of Angular's features such as components, services, pipes, resolvers, guards and routing. It is designed to be a starting point for learning and building more complex Angular applications.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
